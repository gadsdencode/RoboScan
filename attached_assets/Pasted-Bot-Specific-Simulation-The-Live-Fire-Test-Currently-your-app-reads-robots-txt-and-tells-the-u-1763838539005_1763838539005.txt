Bot-Specific Simulation (The "Live Fire" Test)

Currently, your app reads robots.txt and tells the user, "Theoretically, Googlebot is allowed here." However, in the real world, a server firewall (WAF), Cloudflare rule, or .htaccess file might still block that bot, returning a 403 Forbidden error even if robots.txt says "Allow".

This feature bridges the gap between permission (what the file says) and access (what the server actually does).

Why This Matters
False Positives: A user might think their site is AI-ready because robots.txt is perfect, but their hosting provider is silently blocking GPTBot at the network level.

Debugging: If an AI crawler isn't indexing their site, this tool helps them pinpoint if it's a robots.txt issue or a server configuration issue.

How to Implement It
1. Backend Logic (server/routes.ts)
You need a new endpoint that doesn't just download the file, but attempts to access the home page while pretending to be a specific bot.

Concept Code:

TypeScript

// Add to server/routes.ts
app.post("/api/test-bot-access", async (req, res) => {
  const { url, botUserAgent } = req.body;

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: 'HEAD', // We only need headers/status, not the full body
      headers: {
        'User-Agent': botUserAgent 
        // e.g., "Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; GPTBot/1.0; +https://openai.com/gptbot)"
      },
      redirect: 'follow' // Follow redirects to see final destination status
    });

    // If status is 200, it's truly accessible. 
    // If 403/401, it's blocked by firewall/server config.
    res.json({ 
      status: response.status, 
      accessible: response.ok 
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ accessible: false, error: "Connection failed" });
  }
});
2. Frontend UI (client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx)
In your dashboard, where you list the bots (currently generated in scanner.ts), add a "Test" button next to each major bot.

User Action: User clicks "Test Access" next to "GPTBot".

Visual Feedback:

<span style="color:green">200 OK</span>: (Green Badge) "Truly Accessible"

<span style="color:red">403 Forbidden</span>: (Red Badge) "Blocked by Firewall"

<span style="color:orange">406 Not Acceptable</span>: (Yellow Badge) "Server Rejected Headers"
